# This repository was created to contain all the control/configuration files
# for applications that I use inside a linux machine

This repository contains all the below configuration files

1. vimrc : The most needed rc for me. vim is the standard editor that I have
   been using since ever. Can't live without my vimrc. I have .vim/ directory
   as well which contains coloring and other vim plugins.

2. bashrc : Simple bash setup. Many of the commands are specific to some
   companies that I have been working. So, some of them will have to be deleted
   when using for other machines on other projects.

3. screenrc : I was using screen for sometime (like 5 years) and then now, I
   shifted to tmux. But at places where I won't have tmux, I still need to use
   screenrc.

4. tmux.conf : the tmux configuration. Without this file, I cannot use tmux as
   I have gotten used to the custom key shortcuts that I have created.
