# Below are list of tmux configuration that I have for work environment. These
# are taken from lot of websites. Understand what each command does before
# including it to yours.
#
# C-a here is the 'prefix-key'. This is the hot-key to enter into the command
# mode of the tmux. Once the prefix-key is detected, the next things that you
# type will be the commands that you'll be sending to tmux.
# 
# M- is the `Meta` key. In most of the systems, this key is binded to alt- key.

# change prefix-key to Ctrl-a (C-a) from unintuitive/non-egronomic C-b. This is
# because I have gotten used to C-a from screen and I don't have to move my
# index finger to reach 'b'--my little finger is already there on 'a'.

unbind C-b
set -g prefix C-a
bind-key C-a send-prefix

# export TERM=xterm-256color in your rc file. I use ~/.bashrc. Also, if you're
# using putty like me, in setting->terminal->keyboard, select Xterm R6 in
# function keys and keypad.
# set default termial as xter-256color.
set-option -g default-terminal "xterm-256color"

# enable shift-arrow keys (doesn't seem to work as of now).
set-window-option -g xterm-keys on

# These overrides are required for C-arrow keys to work.

# Allow selection and resizing of panes using mouse.

# Change renaming window the C-a A similar to screen.
unbind ,
bind A command-prompt 'rename-window %%'

# Escape acts as Alt- (M-) for sometime before seding the command back to the
# running application. Since I use vim for my editing, it is very painful that
# everytime I hit escape, it treats as a meta character. If I hit any arrow key
# by chance (which I do when I de-select text and move my cursor), it'll change
# the window (I have the configuration of alt+arrow keys to switch windows).
# This command will disabled the waiting time before the escape is sent to the
# application which esentially disabling the meta character behaviour of the
# Escape key.
set -s escape-time 0

# The below two commands might fails on creation of new sessions. Once the
# session is loaded, reload the ~/.tmux.conf file (C-a r) to have commands take
# effect.

# set the foreground color to a shade of green
set status-fg colour70

# set background color to almost matching with the solarized dark background.
